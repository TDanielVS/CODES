First configure an environment usind conda https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/doc/configure_via_anaconda.md

Download the simulator https://www.dropbox.com/sh/64lxq4heqnvsasm/AAC3Oz9mM35y8dXKMIa7ncFea?dl=0.
I recomend use windows version to record train data set, run faster and behavie better with controls or steering wheel. Use linux version to test trained networks.
