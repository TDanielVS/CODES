# CODES

This repo have all source codes of the autonomous navigation from a sclae vehicle using deep neural networks.

#### UDACITY software
In this part we are using Behavioral Cloning Project software.

First configure a virtual environment using Conda https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/doc/configure_via_anaconda.md

Download the simulator https://www.dropbox.com/sh/64lxq4heqnvsasm/AAC3Oz9mM35y8dXKMIa7ncFea?dl=0.
I recomend record the training data set in windows version, it runs faster and have better response using controls or steering wheel. Use linux version to test trained networks.

### ROS Indigo AutoNOMOS mini platform
