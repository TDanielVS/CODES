# CODES

This repo has all source codes of the autonomous navigation from a scale vehicle using deep neural networks.

#### UDACITY software
In this part we are using Behavioral Cloning Project software, all description is on https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3.

First configure a virtual environment using Conda https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/doc/configure_via_anaconda.md

Download the simulator. I recommend record the training data set in windows version, it runs faster and have better response using controls or steering wheel. Use linux version to test trained networks. https://www.dropbox.com/sh/64lxq4heqnvsasm/AAC3Oz9mM35y8dXKMIa7ncFea?dl=0.

### ROS Indigo AutoNOMOS mini platform
We have the model v1, all documentation is on the official web page https://github.com/AutoModelCar/AutoModelCarWiki/wiki

Install ROS indigo or newer version on your computer http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu

Create the conda environment
